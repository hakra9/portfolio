Introduction
SportiveVitality is a comprehensive web application designed to help users manage their health and fitness goals effectively. It features two main functionalities: a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator and a Calorie calculator. The BMI calculator allows users to calculate their BMI based on height and weight inputs, while the Calorie calculator estimates users' daily calorie needs based on various factors such as age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and fitness goals.

Inspiration and Challenges
SportiveVitality was born out of a personal passion for promoting wellness and supporting others in achieving their fitness goals. However, bringing this vision to life presented challenges, particularly in designing and implementing accurate and user-friendly calculators for BMI and Calorie estimation. Despite these hurdles, I remained committed to my vision and approached each obstacle as an opportunity for growth.
